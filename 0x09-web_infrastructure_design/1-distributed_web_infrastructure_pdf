1. load-balancer - Helps direct traffic/load to servers  to prevent one server handling or the 
work and achieve good response times to the clients 
2. Load-balancer is using the round robin algorithm
3. The load balancer is configured to active- active setup
4. The Active-Active configuration distributes the load to all servers while ative-passive the load will be distributed to other 
servers if the current server fails
5. How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works - by enabling data 
from one database server(master) to be replicated to more than one (slave) database servers
6. What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application - the primary node accepte read and writes and the effect ripples to the replica nodes which only accept reads 

ISSUES WITH OUR INFRASTRUCTURE

1. Single Point Of Failuire - the load balancer is a single point of failure if it stops running the whole site will go down (redundency needed)
2. The communication between the server and application is not encrypted which my result to securirty risks
3. This set up also lacks firewalls to scan and filter out "bad traffic" traffic 
4. No monitoring hence we wont have the perfomance  data about our servers
