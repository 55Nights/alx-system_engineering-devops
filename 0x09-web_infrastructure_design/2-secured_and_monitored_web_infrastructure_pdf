1. What are firewalls for - Firewalls filter incoming and outgoing network traffic depending on the organization policies
2. Why is the traffic served over HTTPS - this achieved through the use of SSL
3. certificate this because https is more secure than http as data is encrypted
4. What monitoring is used for - to track changes in program outputs and performance over time and making sure it is behaving as expected
5. How the monitoring tool is collecting data - It gathers performance data from all  application components
6. Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS -  by installing monitoring tools.

ISSUES WITH OUR INFRASTRUCTURE

Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue - not all the network passing is encrypted and applications can be vulnerable to security risks like man in the middle

Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue - it will be a single point of failure and if it stops running it would be hard to write to database
Why having servers with all the same components - can not be scaled up if uses increase
